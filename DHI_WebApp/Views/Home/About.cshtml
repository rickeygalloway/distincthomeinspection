                    <p class="reviews">5 Stars!!!! Kyle performed a THOROUGH home inspection on a house I was attempting purchase for a rental house. After he completed the inspection, I put in a bid for $20,000 and was totally comfortable with it. The seller didn't accept the offer but I was totally at peace with walking away. Best money I have ever spent and it prevented me from getting myself in over my head!! Kyle's inspection was thorough and the documentation was detailed. He responded quickly and completed the paperwork quickly also.</p>
